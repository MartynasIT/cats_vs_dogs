Needed dependancies:
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install Keras

How to run:
Open IDE and run Initializer.py, enter path to the folder with images. 

Description:
There are some tests baked in. To run them use tests.py, it looks at tests folder with images to test all 3 categories.
It uses image resizing to increase speed. 
This is not super accurate since model I used is very light.
This sequential model returns either 1 or 0 when using predict_classes(), 1 meaning dog and 0 cat.
